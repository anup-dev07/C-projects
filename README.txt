In this modified code, the friend declaration inside the Point class uses a template parameter U instead of T and a template parameter S instead of size. This ensures that the friend declaration matches the specialization of the operator<< outside the class. Now, the operator<< function has access to the private m_components member, and the code will compile and execute correctly.

The reason for the thrown compiler error in the original code was the mismatch between the friend declaration inside the class and the specialization of the operator<< outside the class, leading to access restrictions on the private member.
